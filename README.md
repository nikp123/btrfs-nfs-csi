Kubernetes Enterprise storage vibes for your homelab. A single-binary CSI driver that turns any Linux box with a btrfs disk into a full-featured storage backend - instant snapshots, writable clones, per-volume quotas, live compression tuning, NoCOW for databases, and automatic NFS exports. Even with HA via DRBD. No iSCSI, no Ceph, no PhD required.

> **Pre-1.0** - stable, but minor breaking changes may occur before v1.0. Over the past weeks I have rolled out unit tests, integration tests, race-detection tests, NFS export reconciliation, and a web dashboard. Before the 1.0 release, CSI sanity tests, e2e tests, and more will be added. Feedback and bug reports welcome.

### Dashboard

## Why btrfs-nfs-csi?

Most Kubernetes storage solutions are built for the data center: Ceph, Longhorn, and OpenEBS bring clustering overhead, complex operations, and resource requirements that don't fit a homelab or small self-hosted setup. If all you have is a single Linux server (or two for HA) with a btrfs filesystem, you shouldn't need a distributed storage cluster just to get snapshots and quotas.

<details>
<summary><b>btrfs-nfs-csi</b> bridges that gap</summary>

- **Minimal resource footprint** - the agent and driver are single Go binaries with nearly no overhead. No JVM, no database. Runs comfortably on a Raspberry Pi or a 2-core VM.
- **Zero infrastructure overhead** - no etcd, no separate storage cluster, no distributed consensus. One binary on your NFS server, one driver in your cluster.
- **Leverages what btrfs already gives you** - subvolumes become PVs, btrfs snapshots become `VolumeSnapshots`, quotas become capacity tracking. No reinvention.
- **Data integrity without ECC** - btrfs checksums every block. In a homelab where your hardware has no ECC RAM, that's your best defense against silent data corruption.
- **NFS "just works"** - every node can mount every volume without iSCSI initiators, multipath, or block device fencing. ReadWriteMany is the default, not a special case.
- **Homelab-friendly HA** - pair two servers with DRBD + Pacemaker for active/passive failover.
- **Multi-tenant from day one** - a single agent can serve multiple clusters or teams, each isolated by tenant with its own subvolume tree.

</details>

If you run a homelab, a small on-prem cluster, or an edge deployment and want real storage features without the operational tax of a full SDS stack, this driver is for you.

## Features

- Instant snapshots and writable clones (btrfs CoW)
- Online volume expansion
- Per-volume quota enforcement and usage reporting
- Per-volume tuning via StorageClass parameters or PVC annotations:
  - Compression (`zstd`, `lzo`, `zlib` with levels)
  - NoCOW mode (`chattr +C`) for databases
  - UID/GID/mode
- Per-node NFS exports (auto-managed via `exportfs`)
- Multi-tenant: one agent serves multiple clusters
- Multi-device support (RAID0/1/10) with per-device IO stats and error tracking
- Dynamic device discovery, hot-added devices are picked up automatically
- Prometheus `/metrics` on all components
- Web dashboard (`/v1/dashboard`)
- TLS support
- HA via DRBD + Pacemaker (active/passive failover)

**Roadmap:**
NFS-Ganesha support, `VOLUME_CONDITION` health reporting

## Quick Start

For a detailed setup description, see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

**1. Install the agent** on a Linux host with a btrfs filesystem:

```bash
# The agent runs as a privileged Podman container with host networking -
# it listens on port 8080 and manages the host's NFS exports directly.
#
# Environment variables (defaults shown - adjust as needed):
# export AGENT_BASE_PATH=/export/data  # must be a btrfs filesystem
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikmagkekse/btrfs-nfs-csi/main/scripts/quickstart-agent.sh # | sudo -E bash

# Save the tenant token printed at the end!
```

**2. Deploy the CSI driver and StorageClass** in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Create a values.yaml with your agent details:
cat > values.yaml <<EOF
storageClasses:
  - name: btrfs-nfs
    nfsServer: "10.0.0.5"             # your agent's IP
    agentURL: "http://10.0.0.5:8080"
    agentToken: "your-tenant-token"   # from step 1
    isDefault: true

# nfsServer must be reachable from the IP that NFS exports are created for.
# By default the driver uses each node's primary IP (status.hostIP).
# For separate storage networks uncomment one of these:
# driver:
#   storageInterface: "eth1"        # dedicated NIC
#   storageCIDR: "10.10.0.0/24"     # or match by subnet
EOF

helm install btrfs-nfs-csi oci://ghcr.io/erikmagkekse/charts/btrfs-nfs-csi \
  -n btrfs-nfs-csi --create-namespace -f values.yaml

# Wait for the controller to connect to your agent:
kubectl logs -n btrfs-nfs-csi deploy/btrfs-nfs-csi-controller -c csi-driver -f
# Look for: "agent healthy" (a commit mismatch note is fine, only a WRN "version mismatch" is a problem)
```

> For static manifests without Helm, see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md#static-manifests).

**3. That's it, test it!**

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-data
spec:
  accessModes: [ReadWriteMany]
  storageClassName: btrfs-nfs
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
EOF
```

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/assets/architecture.png)

Each StorageClass binds one agent + one tenant. Volume IDs use the StorageClass name, so agent URLs can change without breaking existing volumes.

## Building

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(cat VERSION) -X main.commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" -o btrfs-nfs-csi .
```

## Development

### Agent

```bash
sudo ./scripts/agent-dev-setup.sh up
sudo bash -c "AGENT_BASE_PATH=/tmp/btrfs-nfs-csi-dev AGENT_TENANTS=dev:dev ./btrfs-nfs-csi agent"
sudo ./scripts/agent-dev-setup.sh down
```
